title: Tai Chi Movements
subtitle: 'Our practitoners from Harvard Medical School demonstrated traditional Tai Chi movements which provided valuable insights into natural human motion patterns, particularly focusing on balance, coordination, and range of motion. These observations informed our system design and guided the development of the SLDP mechanism which aims to replicate the fluid and controlled nature of Tai Chi movements.'
