title: 'Spring Loaded Double Pantograph'
subtitle: 'A Spring Loaded Double Pantograph (SLDP) mechanism is presented for safe balance training in elderly individuals practicing Tai Chi exercises. As people age, maintaining balance becomes increasingly critical, yet fear of falling often prevents effective exercise, creating a counterproductive cycle that increases fall risk. This natural hesitation to push physical limits during solo practice highlights the need for reliable safety systems.  This paper presents a mechanism that provides variable assistance through spring-loaded actuation, so that support and freedom of movement can be balanced in a way that is both effective and unobtrusive. Here, it will be shown that, although support and unrestricted movement are traditionally considered contradictory goals, the two can be achieved simultaneously through mechanical design and the level of assistance can be automatically regulated. In this system, the support mechanism can a) detect falls rapidly, b) provide up to 98 % body weight support when needed, and c) remain imperceptible during normal exercise.'
